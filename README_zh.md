`leetgo` is a command line tool that generates skeleton code for LeetCode questions in many languages. You can run and debug test cases locally with your favorite IDE.
Then you can submit your code to LeetCode directly.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/0sUG7psmMfgWqzy9rr57hrcnX.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/0sUG7psmMfgWqzy9rr57hrcnX)

`leetgo` supports generating contest questions as well.

TODO: add a https://asciinema.org/

**This project is in its early development stage, and anything is likely to change.**

## Highlight of features

- Search for and view a question by its ID or slug.
- Generate skeleton code and testing code for a question.
- Run test cases on your local machine.
- Generate contest questions just in time.

## Language support

Currently, `leetgo` supports generating code and local test for the following languages:
<!-- BEGIN MATRIX -->
|  | Generate | Local Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Go | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| Python | :white_check_mark: | :x: |

## LeetCode Support

Leetgo uses LeetCode's GraphQL API to get questions and submit solutions. You need to provide your LeetCode session ID to authenticate.

Currently only `leetcode.cn` is supported. `leetcode.com` is under development.

## Configuration

Leetgo reads global configuration from `~/.config/leetgo/config.yaml` and local configuration from `leetgo.yaml` in your project root, which are generated automatically when you run `leetgo init`.
You can tweak the configuration to your liking.

<!-- BEGIN CONFIG -->
```yaml
# Your name
author: Bob
# Language of the question description: zh or en
language: zh
# Code configuration
code:
  # Language of code generated for questions: go, python, ... 
  # (will be override by project config and flag --lang)
  lang: go
  # The default template to generate filename (without extension), e.g. {{.Id}}.{{.Slug}}
  # Available attributes: Id, Slug, Title, Difficulty, Lang, SlugIsMeaningful
  # Available functions: lower, upper, trim, padWithZero, toUnderscore
  filename_template: '{{ .Id | padWithZero 4 }}{{ if .SlugIsMeaningful }}.{{ .Slug }}{{ end }}'
  # The mark to indicate the beginning of the code
  code_begin_mark: '@lc code=start'
  # The mark to indicate the end of the code
  code_end_mark: '@lc code=end'
  go:
    out_dir: go

```
<!-- END CONFIG -->

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems, please run your command with `DEBUG` environment variable set to `1`, copy the command output and open an issue.
