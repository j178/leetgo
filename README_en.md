*Warning: This project is still in its early development stage and many features have not yet been implemented. Everything is subject to rapid change.*

**[中文](./README.md) | English**

`leetgo` is a command-line tool for LeetCode that provides almost all the functionality of LeetCode, 
allowing you to complete all of your LeetCode exercises without leaving the terminal. 
It can automatically generate **skeleton code and test cases**, support **local testing and debugging**, 
and you can use any IDE you like to solve problems. 

And `leetgo` also supports real-time generation of **contest questions**, so your submissions are one step ahead!

## Highlight of features

- Generate description, skeleton code and testing code for a question
- Customize the code template for generated code, use modifiers to preprocess code
- Run test cases on your local machine
- Wait and generate contest questions just in time, test and submit all at once
- Support both leetcode.com and leetcode.cn
- Read cookies from browser automatically, no need to provide password
- Auto open question files in your favorite editor

## Language support

`leetgo` supports generating code for most languages, and local test skeleton for some languages.

Local test means that you can run the test cases on your local machine, so you can use a debugger to debug your code.

Local test requires more work to implement for each language, so not all languages are supported.

<!-- END USAGE -->

### Question Identifier

Many `leetgo` commands rely on `qid` to locate the leetcode question. `qid` is a simplified question 
identifier defined by leetgo, which includes the following forms (using the two-sum problem as an example):

```shell
leetgo pick two-sum          # by question slug
leetgo pick 1                # by question id
leetgo pick today            # daily question
leetgo test last             # the last generated question
leetgo test weekly100/1      # the first question of weekly contest 100
leetgo submit b100/2         # the second question of bi-weekly contest 100
leetgo submit w99/           # all questions of biweekly contest 99 (must keep the trailing slash)
leetgo test last/1           # the first question of the last generated contest
leetgo test last/            # all questions of the last generated contest (must keep the trailing slash)
```

## Configuration

Leetgo uses two levels of configuration files, the global configuration file located at `~/.config/leetgo/config.yaml` and the local configuration file located at `leetgo.yaml` in the project root. 

These configuration files are generated during the `leetgo init` process. 
The local configuration file in the project will override the global configuration. 

It is generally recommended to use the global configuration as the default configuration and customize it in the project by modifying the `leetgo.yaml` file.

Here is the demonstration of full configurations:

<!-- BEGIN CONFIG -->
```yaml
# Your name
author: Bob
# Language of the question description: zh or en
language: zh
# Code configuration
code:
  # Language of code generated for questions: go, python, ... 
  # (will be override by project config and flag --lang)
  lang: go
  # The default template to generate filename (without extension), e.g. {{.Id}}.{{.Slug}}
  # Available attributes: Id, Slug, Title, Difficulty, Lang, SlugIsMeaningful
  # Available functions: lower, upper, trim, padWithZero, toUnderscore
  filename_template: '{{ .Id | padWithZero 4 }}{{ if .SlugIsMeaningful }}.{{ .Slug }}{{ end }}'
  # Functions that modify the generated code
  modifiers:
    - name: removeUselessComments
  go:
    out_dir: go
    # Overrides the default code.filename_template
    filename_template: ""
    # Replace some blocks of the generated code

        template: |+
          package main

<!-- END CONFIG -->

## LeetCode Support

`leetgo` uses LeetCode's GraphQL API to get questions and submit solutions. `leetgo` needs your LeetCode cookies to access authenticated API.

There are three ways to provide cookies to `leetgo`:

- Read cookies from browser automatically.
  
  Currently, Chrome and FireFox are supported, if you want to support other browsers, please let us know!

  ```yaml
  leetcode:
    credentials:
      from: browser
  ```

- Provide cookies in config file.
  
  You can get your cookies named `LEETCODE_SESSION` and `csrftoken` from browser's developer tools.

  ```yaml
  leetcode:
    credentials:
      from: cookies
      session: xxx
      csrftoken: xx
  ```

- Provide username and password in config file.

  You need to run `leetgo config encrypt` to encrypt your password first, plain text password is **not allowed**.

  ```yaml
  leetcode:
    credentials:
      from: password
      username: xxx
      password: |
        $LEETGO_VAULT;1.1;AES256
        61393232326161303064373437376538646432623336363563623935333863653666623633376466
        3836633339643934383061363239333833333634373137620a303466626335633332393336326564
        31633231333934323165376362646630643132626130626136326163333133663762356264353564
        6562653462396335300a313761363531363961656364366634666562663061633161366463393339
        3963
  ```

**Note**: username/password authentication is not recommended, and it is not supported by `leetcode.com`.

## Advanced Usage

1. template related

   `leetgo` 的配置中有许多支持 Go template，如果你熟悉 Go template 语法的话，可以配置出更加个性化的文件名和代码模板。

2. Blocks

   可以用 blocks 来自定义代码中的一些部分，目前支持的 block 有：
   - header
   - description
   - title
   - beforeMarker
   - beforeCode
   - code
   - afterCode
   - afterMarker

   Example:
   ```yaml
   code:
   lang: cpp
   cpp:
   blocks:
   - name: beforeCode
     template: |
       #include <iostream>
       using namespace std;
   - name: afterMarker
     template: |
       int main() {}
   ```

3. Script

   `leetgo` 支持自定义一个 JavaScript 脚本来处理函数代码，示例：
    ```yaml
    code:
      lang: cpp
      cpp:
        modifiers:
        - name: removeUselessComments
        - script: |
            function modify(code) {
              return "// hello world\n" + code;
            } 
    ```
