`leetgo` is a command-line tool for LeetCode that provides almost all the functionality of LeetCode,
allowing you to do all of your LeetCode exercises without leaving the terminal.
It can automatically generate **skeleton code and test cases**, support **local testing and debugging**,
and you can use any IDE you like to solve problems.

And `leetgo` also supports real-time generation of **contest questions**, submitting all questions at once, so your submissions are always one step ahead!

## Features

- Generate description, skeleton code and testing code for a question
- Customize the code template for generated code, use modifiers to pre-process code
- Execute test cases on your local machine
- Wait and generate contest questions just in time, test and submit all at once
- Support for both leetcode.com and leetcode.cn
- Automatically read cookies from browser, no need to enter password
- Automatically open question files in your favourite editor
- Use OpenAI to automatically discover and fix issues in the code (Experimental)

## Language support

`leetgo` supports code generation for most languages, and local testing for some languages.

In the Go language, running `leetgo pick 257` will generate the following code:

```go
// Omitted some code...
// @lc code=begin

func binaryTreePaths(root *TreeNode) (ans []string) {

	return
}

// @lc code=end

func main() {
	stdin := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
	root := Deserialize[*TreeNode](ReadLine(stdin))
	ans := binaryTreePaths(root)
	fmt.Println("output: " + Serialize(ans))
}
```

This is a complete and runnable program. You can run it directly, input the test cases, and compare the results. 
`leetgo test -L` will automatically run this program with the test cases in `testcases.txt` and compare the results.

Local testing means that you can run the test cases on your local machine, so you can use a debugger to debug your code.

Local testing requires more work to implement for each language, so not all languages are supported.

<!-- END USAGE -->

### Question Identifier

Many `leetgo` commands rely on `qid` to find the leetcode question. `qid` is a simplified question
identifier defined by leetgo, which includes the following forms (using the two-sum problem as an example):

```shell
leetgo pick two-sum          # `two-sum` is the question slug
leetgo pick 1                # `1` is the question id
leetgo pick today            # `today` means daily question
leetgo pick yesterday        # `yesterday` means the question of yesterday
leetgo pick today-1          # `today-1` means the question of yesterday, same as `yesterday`. `today-2`, `today-3` etc are also supported.
leetgo contest weekly100     # `weekly100` means the 100th weekly contest
leetgo test last             # `last` means the last generated question
leetgo test weekly100/1      # `weekly100/1` means the first question of the 100th weekly contest
leetgo submit b100/2         # `b100/2` means the second question of the 100th biweekly contest
leetgo submit w99/           # `w99/` means all questions of the 99th biweekly contest (must keep the trailing slash)
leetgo test last/1           # `last/1` means the first question of the last generated contest
leetgo test last/            # `last/` means all questions of the last generated contest (must keep the trailing slash)
```

## Configuration

Leetgo uses two levels of configuration files, the global configuration file located at `~/.config/leetgo/config.yaml` and the local configuration file located at `leetgo.yaml` in the project root.

These configuration files are created during the `leetgo init` process.
The local configuration file in the project overrides the global configuration.

It is generally recommended to use the global configuration as the default configuration and customize it in the project by modifying the `leetgo.yaml` file.

Here is the demonstration of complete configurations:

## LeetCode Support

`leetgo` uses LeetCode's GraphQL API to retrieve questions and submit solutions. `leetgo` needs your LeetCode cookies to access the authenticated API.

There are three ways to make cookies available to `leetgo`:

- Read cookies from browser automatically.

  Currently, `leetgo` supports Chrome, FireFox, Safari[^1], Edge.

  ```yaml
  leetcode:
    credentials:
      from: browser
  ```

- Provide cookies in config file.

  You can get your cookies named `LEETCODE_SESSION` and `csrftoken` from browser's developer tools.

  ```yaml
  leetcode:
    credentials:
      from: cookies
      session: xxx
      csrftoken: xx
  ```

- Provide username and password in config file.

  You need to run `leetgo config encrypt` to encrypt your password first, plain text password is **not allowed**.

  ```yaml
  leetcode:
    credentials:
      from: password
      username: xxx
      password: |
        $LEETGO_VAULT;1.1;AES256
        61393232326161303064373437376538646432623336363563623935333863653666623633376466

        3963
  ```

> **Note**
> Password authentication is not recommended, and it is not supported by `leetcode.com`.

## Advanced Usage

### Templates

Several fields in leetgo's config file support templating. These fields are often suffixed with `_template`.
You can use custom template to generate your own filename, code, etc.

### Blocks

A code file is composed of different blocks, you can overwrite some of them to provide your own snippets.

| Available blocks |
| -- |
| header |
| description |
| title |
| beforeMarker |
| beforeCode |
| code |
| afterCode |
| afterMarker |

For example:
```yaml
code:
lang: cpp
cpp:
  blocks:
  - name: beforeCode
    template: |
      #include <iostream>
      using namespace std;
  - name: afterMarker
    template: |
      int main() {}
```

### Scripting

`leetgo` supports providing a JavaScript function to handle the code before generation, for example:

```yaml
code:
  lang: cpp
  cpp:
    modifiers:
    - name: removeUselessComments
    - script: |
        function modify(code) {
          return "// hello world\n" + code;
        }
```
