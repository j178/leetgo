*This project is still in its early development stage and many features have not yet been implemented. Everything is subject to rapid change.*

[中文](./README_zh.md) | English

`leetgo` is a command-line tool for LeetCode that provides almost all the functionality of LeetCode, 
allowing you to complete all of your LeetCode exercises without leaving the terminal. 
It can automatically generate **skeleton code and test cases**, support **local testing and debugging**, 
and you can use any IDE you like to solve problems. 

And `leetgo` also supports real-time generation of **contest questions**, so your submissions are one step ahead!

## Highlight of features

- Pick question with a simple and fancy UI.
- Generate skeleton code and testing code for a question.
- Run test cases on your local machine.
- Generate contest questions just in time.
- Support both leetcode.com and leetcode.cn
- Read cookies from browser automatically, no need to provide password.

## Language support

`leetgo` supports generating code for most languages, and local test skeleton for some languages.

Local test means that you can run the test cases on your local machine, so you can use a debugger to debug your code.

Local test requires more work to implement for each language, so not all languages are supported.

<!-- BEGIN MATRIX -->

| --- | --- | --- |
| Go | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| Python | :white_check_mark: | :x: |
| C++ | :white_check_mark: | :x: |

and many other languages are in plan. (help wanted, contributions welcome!)

<!-- END USAGE -->

### Question Identifier

Many `leetgo` commands rely on `qid` to locate the leetcode question. `qid` is a simplified question 
identifier defined by leetgo, which includes the following forms (using the two-sum problem as an example):

```shell
leetgo pick two-sum          # by question slug
leetgo pick 1                # by question id
leetgo pick today            # daily question
leetgo test last             # the last generated question
leetgo test weekly100/1      # the first question of weekly contest 100
leetgo submit b100/2         # the second question of bi-weekly contest 100
leetgo submit w99/           # all questions of biweekly contest 99 (must keep the trailing slash)
leetgo test last/1           # the first question of the last generated contest
leetgo test last/            # all questions of the last generated contest (must keep the trailing slash)
```

## Configuration

Leetgo uses two levels of configuration files, the global configuration file located at `~/.config/leetgo/config.yaml` and the local configuration file located at `leetgo.yaml` in the project root. 

These configuration files are generated during the `leetgo init` process. 
The local configuration file in the project will override the global configuration. 

It is generally recommended to use the global configuration as the default configuration and customize it in the project by modifying the `leetgo.yaml` file.

Here is the demonstration of full configurations:

<!-- BEGIN CONFIG -->
```yaml
# Your name
author: Bob
# Language of the question description: zh or en
language: zh
# Code configuration
code:
  # Language of code generated for questions: go, python, ... 
  # (will be override by project config and flag --lang)
  lang: go
  # The default template to generate filename (without extension), e.g. {{.Id}}.{{.Slug}}
  # Available attributes: Id, Slug, Title, Difficulty, Lang, SlugIsMeaningful
  # Available functions: lower, upper, trim, padWithZero, toUnderscore
  filename_template: '{{ .Id | padWithZero 4 }}{{ if .SlugIsMeaningful }}.{{ .Slug }}{{ end }}'
  # The mark to indicate the beginning of the code
  code_begin_mark: '@lc code=start'
  # The mark to indicate the end of the code
  code_end_mark: '@lc code=end'
  go:
    out_dir: go
    # Overrides the default code.filename_template
    filename_template: ""
    # Go module path for the generated code
    go_mod_path: ""
  python3:
    out_dir: python
    # Overrides the default code.filename_template
    filename_template: ""
  cpp:
    out_dir: cpp
    # Overrides the default code.filename_template
    filename_template: ""
  java:
    out_dir: java
    # Overrides the default code.filename_template
    filename_template: ""
  rust:
    out_dir: rust
    # Overrides the default code.filename_template
    filename_template: ""
# LeetCode configuration

  # Credentials to access LeetCode

    # LeetCode cookie: LEETCODE_SESSION
    session: ""

  # Base dir to put generated contest questions
  out_dir: contest
  # Template to generate filename of the question
  filename_template: '{{ .Id }}{{ if .SlugIsMeaningful }}.{{ .Slug }}{{ end }}'
  # Open the contest page in browser after generating
  open_in_browser: true
# The editor to open generated files

  # Use a predefined editor: vim, vscode, goland
  # Set to 'none' to disable, set to 'custom' to provide your own command

```
<!-- END CONFIG -->

## LeetCode Support

Currently only `leetcode.cn` is supported. Support for `leetcode.com` is under development.

`leetgo` uses LeetCode's GraphQL API to get questions and submit solutions. `leetgo` needs your LeetCode cookies to access authenticated API.

There are three ways to provide cookies to `leetgo`:

- Read cookies from browser automatically.
  
  Currently only chrome is supported, if you want to support other browsers, please let us know!

  ```yaml
  leetcode:
    credentials:
      from: browser
  ```

- Provide cookies in config file.
  
  You can get your cookies named `LEETCODE_SESSION` and `csrftoken` from browser's developer tools.

  ```yaml
  leetcode:
    credentials:
      from: cookies
      session: xxx
      csrftoken: xx
  ```

- Provide username and password in config file.

  You need to run `leetgo config encrypt` to encrypt your password first, plain text password is **not allowed**.

  ```yaml
  leetcode:
    credentials:
      from: password
      username: xxx
      password: |
        $LEETGO_VAULT;1.1;AES256
        61393232326161303064373437376538646432623336363563623935333863653666623633376466
        3836633339643934383061363239333833333634373137620a303466626335633332393336326564
        31633231333934323165376362646630643132626130626136326163333133663762356264353564
        6562653462396335300a313761363531363961656364366634666562663061633161366463393339
        3963
  ```

**Note**: username/password authentication is not recommended, and it is not supported by `leetcode.com`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems, please run your command with `DEBUG` environment variable set to `1`, copy the command output and open an issue.
